instances:
  # By default, this check will run against a single instance - the current
  # machine that the Agent is running on. It will check the WMI performance
  # counters for IIS on that machine.
  #
  # If you want to check other remote machines as well, you can add one
  # instance per host. Note: If you also want to check the counters on the
  # current machine, you will have to create an instance with empty params.
  #
  # The `sites` parameter allows you to specify a list of sites you want to
  # read metrics from. With sites specified, metrics will be tagged with the
  # site name, and an agent check will be created for each site. If you don't 
  # define any sites, the check will pull the aggregate values across all sites.
  #
  # The `tag_all_sites` parameter allows you to read metrics from all sites 
  # without having to specify site names. Sites will be tagged with their name.
  # To be alerted in case a site is stoppped or missing, you must create
  # a new Integration Monitor on `iis.site_up` and set it to alert 
  # if data is missing.  
  # 
  # Here's an example of configuration that would check the current machine
  # and a remote machine called MYREMOTESERVER. For the remote host we are
  # only pulling metrics from the default site.
  #
  # "." means the current host
  # - host: .
  #   tags:
  #     - myapp1
  #   sites:
  #     - Default Web Site
  #
  # - host: MYREMOTESERVER
  #   username: MYREMOTESERVER\fred
  #   password: mysecretpassword
  #   tags:
  #     - myapp2
  #     - east
  #   sites:
  #     - Default Web Site
  #
  # Report metrics for all sites on local host
  # - host: .
